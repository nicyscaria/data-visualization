## Data Visualization

The dataset used for visualization exercise is the [Enrolment of Students in Different Grades Based on their Age in India](https://data.gov.in/resource/enrolment-age-and-class-udise-plus-during-2019-20) dataset from [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/). This dataset contains data of enrolment of students in different grades in all districts in India. For the visualization exercise, I have considered data of student enrolment in the districts of Kerala only. 

### Bar plot

Bar plot is a good way to compare two quantities of interest. In this case, it is the enrolment of the number of boys and girls in each
grade. It can be observed that from grade 1 to 10, the number of boys enroled is higher than the number of girls. but in grade 11 and
12, the number of girls are more. In a state with sex ratio more than 1000 (1084, as per 2011 census), it is surprising to see that the
enrolment of girls is less than boys. But when it comes to higher grades, the drop out is more in case of boys.
